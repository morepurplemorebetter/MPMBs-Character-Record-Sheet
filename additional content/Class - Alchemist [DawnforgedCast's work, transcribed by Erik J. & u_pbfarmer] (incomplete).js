/*  -WHAT IS THIS?-
	The script featured here is made as an optional addition to "MPMB's Character Record Sheet" found at http://flapkan.com/mpmb/dmsguild
	You can add the content to the Character Sheet's functionality by adding the script below in the "Add Custom Script" dialogue.
 
	-KEEP IN MIND-
	Note that you can add as many custom codes as you want, but you have to add the code in at once (i.e. copy all the code into a single, long file and copy that into the sheet).
	It is recommended to enter the code in a fresh sheet before adding any other information.

/*  -INFORMATION-
	Subject:	Class
	Effect:		This script adds the class called "Alchemist" and its 3 subclasses known as Research Focuses "Arcane Distiller", "Grenadier", and "Metamorph"
				This is taken from DawnforgedCast (https://dawnforgedcast.myshopify.com/products/5th-edition-alchemist-class)
				This content is made by Erik J
	Original:	Erik
	Completed:	/u/pbfarmer
	Date:		2017-09-22 (sheet v12.998)
 
	Code Version:	1.0
 
	Please support the creator of this content (DawnforgedCast) and download their material from their website: http://dawnforgedcast.org/
*/

/*	-IMPORTANT NOTICE-
	This code has not been corrected by MPMB to his usual rigid standards. He only corrected errors in the code, but hasn't compared the content to the original source.
	Things will not look as polished as with the other pre-written code that you can find in the same folder. For example, descriptions for class features will overflow their allowed space.
	Also, automation for spell selection isn't fully functional for several of the subclass features.
