--- Readme for the 'Fan-made Additions' folder ----

This folder contains a number of scripts that can be used to add extra content to MPMB's Character Record Sheet.
Note that a lot of the "Unearthed Arcana" material is gone as fromfrom v12.7 onwards, it is integrated in the sheet directly. You can add these materials by using the "Sources" button.

You can do this by following these steps:
1) Open a fresh instance of the latest version of MPMB's Character Record Sheet (found here: http://flapkan.com/mpmb/dmsguild).
2) Click on the bookmark "Add User Script", or go to the 'JavaScript window', click on "Im/Export" and select "Add user script" from the menu. This should open a dialogue. 
3) Open the .js file in a text editor (e.g. Notepad/TextEdit).
4) Copy the entire content of the file to the dialogue and press "Add Script".

>> Note that you can add as many scripts as you want, simply add the script to the text you see in the dialogue.

>> Be sure to add any scripts you want to use before actually filling out the sheet. Adding a script might cause fields to be reset.

>> Each of the files in this folder has comments at the start with information on what the file offers, who made the content, and (if possible) a link to the original content. As always, the abbreviated content provided with these files is meant as a mnemonic and not a replacement for the full description.


You can create your own custom JavaScript to add stuff to MPMB's Character Record Sheet by following the syntax found here: http://flapkan.com/mpmb/syntax

If you decide to make extra content for the sheet, please consider sending me a copy (flapkan@gmail.com) so that I can put it on the "Fan-made Additions" Dropbox/GitHub. Please send your code in a .txt file as gmail has a tendency to remove .js attachments.

Good luck with adding extra content and have fun with the sheets!

Cheers,
