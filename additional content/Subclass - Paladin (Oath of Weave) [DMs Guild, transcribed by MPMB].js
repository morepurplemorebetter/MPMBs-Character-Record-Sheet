/*	-WHAT IS THIS?-
	The script featured here is made as an optional addition to "MPMB's Character Record Sheet" found at http://flapkan.com/mpmb/dmsguild
	You can add the content to the Character Sheet's functionality by adding the script below in the "Add Custom Script" dialogue.
	
	-KEEP IN MIND-
	Note that you can add as many custom codes as you want, but you have to add the code in at once (i.e. copy all the code into a single, long file and copy that into the sheet).
	It is recommended to enter the code in a fresh sheet before adding any other information.

/*	-INFORMATION-
	Subject:	Subclass
	Effect:		This script adds a subclass for the Paladin, called "Oath of the Weave"
				This is taken from the 'Forgotten Realms Archetypes II: Champions of Mystery' made by Jeremy Forbing & Leo David Pakirdjian (http://www.dmsguild.com/product/211385)
	Code by:	MorePurpleMoreBetter
	Date:		2017-09-04 (sheet v12.998)
	
	Please support the creators of this content (Jeremy Forbing & Leo David Pakirdjian) and download their material from the DMs Guild website: http://www.dmsguild.com/browse.php?x=0&y=0&author=Jeremy%20Forbing  &  http://www.dmsguild.com/browse.php?x=0&y=0&author=Leo%20David%20Pakirdjian
	
	Note:		Because this subclass is so verbose, not all features will fit into the Class Features section of the character sheet and the field will overflow!
	
	Caution:	MorePurpleMoreBetter advises against using this subclass as it breaks game balance (it is clearly overpowered). This code was made on commission for a patron.
