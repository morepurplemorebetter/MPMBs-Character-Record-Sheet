/*  -WHAT IS THIS?-
  The script featured here is made as an optional addition to "MPMB's Character Record Sheet" found at http://flapkan.com/mpmb/dmsguild
  You can add the content to the Character Sheet's functionality by adding the script below in the "Add Custom Script" dialogue.

  Note that you can add as many custom codes as you want, but you have to add the code in at once (i.e. copy all the code into a single, long file and copy that into the sheet).
  It is recommended to enter the code in a fresh sheet before adding any other information.
