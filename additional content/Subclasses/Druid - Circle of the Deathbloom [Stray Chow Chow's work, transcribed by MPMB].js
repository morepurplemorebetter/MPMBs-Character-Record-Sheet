/*  -INFORMATION-
  Subject:  Subclass
  Effect:   This script adds a subclass for the druid, called "Circle of the Deathbloom"
        This is taken from Dungeon Masters Guild (http://www.dmsguild.com/product/173273) and is the version from 31st of August 2016
        This subclass is made by Stray Chow Chow
        Note that this is not the latest version of this subclass and the author of it no longer actively supports it on DMs Guild
  Code by:  MorePurpleMoreBetter
  Date:   2018-01-02 (sheet v12.999)

  Please support the creator of this content (Stray Chow Chow) and download their material from DM Guild: http://www.dmsguild.com/browse.php?author=Stray%20Chow%20Chow

  Note that although the Druid is able to wild shape into blights, those won't appear in the menu. You can use these wild shapes only by typing the name of the creature into the "Make a Selection" drop-down box on the Wild Shape pages.
  Also, this script doesn't include a way to add the Spore Servant template to wild shapes.
