/*  -WHAT IS THIS?-
  The script featured here is made as an optional addition to "MPMB's Character Record Sheet" found at http://flapkan.com/mpmb/dmsguild
  You can add the content to the Character Sheet's functionality by adding the script below in the "Add Custom Script" dialogue.

  -KEEP IN MIND-
  Note that you can add as many custom codes as you want, but you have to add the code in at once (i.e. copy all the code into a single, long file and copy that into the sheet).
  It is recommended to enter the code in a fresh sheet before adding any other information.
