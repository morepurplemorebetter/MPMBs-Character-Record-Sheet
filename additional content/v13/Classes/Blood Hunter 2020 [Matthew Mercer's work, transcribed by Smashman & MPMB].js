/*	-INFORMATION-
	Subject:	Class
	Effect:		This script adds a class called "Blood Hunter" (version of 11 Feb 2020)
				and the four subclasses for it: "Order of the Ghostslayer",
				"Order of the Profane Soul", "Order of the Mutant", and "Order of the Lycan"

				This is taken from the DMs Guild website (https://www.dmsguild.com/product/301641/)
				This class and subclasses are made by Matthew Mercer

	Code by:	Smashman & MorePurpleMoreBetter
	Date:		2020-03-03 (sheet v13.0.0beta27)

	Please support the creator of this content (Matthew Mercer) and download his material from the DMs Guild website:
	https://www.dmsguild.com/browse.php?x=0&y=0&author=Matthew%20Mercer

	Please take note that multiclassing the "Order of the Profane Soul" subclass with the Warlock class will
	result in the wrong amount of spells/cantrips being asked for in the spell selection dialogues.
