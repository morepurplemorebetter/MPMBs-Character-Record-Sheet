/*	-WHAT IS THIS?-
	The script featured here is made as an optional addition to "MPMB's Character Record Sheet" found at http://flapkan.com/mpmb/dmsguild
	You can add the content to the Character Sheet's functionality by adding the script below in the "Add Custom Script" dialogue.

	-KEEP IN MIND-
	Note that you can add as many custom codes as you want, but you have to add the code in at once (i.e. copy all the code into a single, long file and copy that into the sheet).
	It is recommended to enter the code in a fresh sheet before adding any other information.

/*	-INFORMATION-
	Subject:	Class
	Effect:		This script adds a class called "Blood Hunter" (v1.8) and the three subclasses for it: "Order of the Ghostslayer", "Order of the Profane Soul", "Order of the Mutant", and "Order of the Lycan"
	
				This is taken from the DMs Guild website (http://www.dmsguild.com/product/170777/)
				This class and subclasses are made by Matthew Mercer
				
				The script now (2016-12-16) also includes the "Order of the Lycan" (v1.4), which is taken from http://www.dmsguild.com/product/175606/
				
	Code by:	Darryl Cook & MorePurpleMoreBetter
				Order of the Lycan code by MorePurpleMoreBetter
	Date:		2017-09-22 (sheet v12.998)

	Please support the creator of this content (Matthew Mercer) and download his material from the DMs Guild website: http://www.dmsguild.com/browse.php?x=0&y=0&author=Matthew%20Mercer
	
	Please take note that multiclassing the "Order of the Profane Soul" subclass with Warlock will result in too many spells/cantrips being asked for in the spell selection dialogues.
