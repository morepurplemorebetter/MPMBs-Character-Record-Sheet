/*	-WHAT IS THIS?-
	The script featured here is an explanation of how to make your own custom addition to MPMB's D&D 5e Character Tools.
	You can add custom content to the Character Sheet's functionality by adding a script written with the syntax shown below in the "Add Custom Script" dialogue.
	
	-KEEP IN MIND-
	Note that you can add as many custom codes as you want, but you have to add the code in at once (i.e. copy all the code into a single, long file and copy that into the sheet).
	It is recommended to enter the code in a fresh sheet before adding any other information.
*/

/*	-INFORMATION-
	Subject:	Class
	Effect:		This is the syntax for adding a new race to the sheet
				Note that you will need to define the race once for every sub-race (i.e. there is a separate entry for High Elf, Wood Elf, and Dark Elf)
				For races that have variants, like the human, you can define a variant using the RaceSubList. Any variant defined like that will only be selectable through the "Racial Options" button
	Sheet:		v12.998 (2017-09-22)

RaceList["something catlike"] = { //Object name; Note the use of only lower case! Also note the absence of the word "var" and the use of brackets []

	regExpSearch : /^(?=.*something)(?=.*catlike).*$/i, //required; regular expression of what to look for (i.e. now it looks for any entry that has both the words "something" and "catlike" in it, disregarding capitalization). If this looks to complicated, just write: /something catlike/i
	
	name : "Something Catlike", //required; the name to use for the race
	
	sortname : "Catlike, Something", //optional; this is the name used to fill the drop-down boxes. If you don't include this, the 'name' will used instead
	
	source : ["HB", 0], //required; the source and the page number. "HB" stands for homebrew. See the "Complete SourceList" for an overview of sources that are already defined. Or define a new source using the "Homebrew Syntax - SourceList.js". // This can be an array of arrays to indicate the things appears in multiple sources. For example, if something appears on page 7 of the Elemental Evil Player's Companion and on page 115 of the Sword Coast Adventure Guide, use the following: [["E", 7], ["S", 115]]
	
	plural : "Somethings Catlike", //required; the name to use for the race when the plural form is used

		// all of the following attributes are optional and you can add more ("borrow" isn't part of this example!)
		
		walk : { spd : 30, enc : 20 }, // the objects "walk", "borrow", "climb", "fly", "swim" are all the same, they are an object with two attributes, 'spd' for the speed in feet, and 'enc' for the encumbered speed in feet.
		
		climb : { spd : "+50", enc : 0 }, // instead of numbers, you can also have modifiers. Modifiers are a string, starting with a mathematical operator, followed by a number (e.g. "-10", "+20"). // a value that is zero is ignored
		
		fly : { spd : "walk", enc : 0 }, // instead of a number/modifier, you can also set the attribute to "walk". This makes the speed mode assume the walking speed // Using an underscore as the first character means the value is only added if the value would be non-zero
		
		swim : { spd : "fixed60", enc : "fixed60" }, // if you include the word "fixed" together with a number, the movement mode will be that number, without any modifiers from other sources (like the Monk's speed bonus). However, if another entry that isn't 'fixed' does end up with a higher total while including any modifiers, that speed is used instead
		
		allModes : "+10" // the 'allModes' attribute can only consist of a modifier. This modifier is applied to all speed modes, both normal and encumbered. It is only applied if the speed mode exists, it won't give the character a borrow speed if it would otherwise have none, for example
