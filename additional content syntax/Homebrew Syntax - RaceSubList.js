/*	-WHAT IS THIS?-
	The script featured here is an explanation of how to make your own custom addition to MPMB's D&D 5e Character Tools.
	You can add custom content to the Character Sheet's functionality by adding a script written with the syntax shown below in the "Add Custom Script" dialogue.
	
	-KEEP IN MIND-
	Note that you can add as many custom codes as you want, but you have to add the code in at once (i.e. copy all the code into a single, long file and copy that into the sheet).
	It is recommended to enter the code in a fresh sheet before adding any other information.

/*	-INFORMATION-
	Subject:	Class
	Effect:		This is the syntax for adding a new racial variant to the sheet
				If you want to define several subraces, please do so by defining multiple entries of the RaceList (i.e. there is a separate entry for High Elf, Wood Elf, and Dark Elf in the RaceList)
				For races that have variants, like the human, you can define a variant using the RaceSubList. Any variant defined like this will only be selectable through the "Racial Options" button
	Sheet:		v12.998 (2017-09-15)

RaceSubList["something catlike-something great catlike"] = { //Object name;  The name of the object must be the name of the parent ClassList entry ("something catlike" in this example), followed by a dash ("-"), followed by the name of the variant ("something great catlike" in this example), as defined in the 'variants' array in the ClassList entry (see bottom line). Note the use of only lower case! Also note the absence of the word "var" and the use of brackets []

	regExpSearch : /^(?=.*something)(?=.*great)(?=.*catlike).*$/i, //required; regular expression of what to look for (i.e. now it looks for any entry that has both the words "something", "great" and "catlike" in it, disregarding capitalization). If this looks to complicated, just write: /something great catlike/i This lookup is in addition to the one from the parent in the RaceList. So if the name of this subrace does not include the name of the parent race, it will never be recognized!
	
	name : "Something Great Catlike", //required; the name to use for the race
	
	source : ["HB", 0], //required; the source and the page number. "HB" stands for homebrew. See the "Complete SourceList" for an overview of sources that are already defined. Or define a new source using the "Homebrew Syntax - SourceList.js". // This can be an array of arrays to indicate the things appears in multiple sources. For example, if something appears on page 7 of the Elemental Evil Player's Companion and on page 115 of the Sword Coast Adventure Guide, use the following: [["E", 7], ["S", 115]]
	
	plural : "Somethings Great Catlike", //required; the name to use for the race when the plural form is used
	
	// after defining the above four, you don't need to define anything more, but you can. Defining more stuff will overwrite the entries as they are given in the RaceList. So if you do not need something to be different than the basics of the class (for example, you subrace uses the same spellcasting ability, or has the same age description), then you don't need to define it again.
	// For the syntax of how to define more stuff, look at the RaceList (see "Homebrew Syntax - RaceList.js"). You can define all the same stuff in the same way. The below are a couple of examples:
	
	speed : ["30 ft\n30 ft fly", "20 ft\n20 ft fly"], //optional; changes the speed to something else. Note that speed can be either just a number, or a string. Using just a number is faster. Only use a string when you need to add something more (like a fly speed)
	
	trait : "Something Great Catlike (+1 Dexterity, +2 Wisdom)\nWings:\n   I have bat-like wings sprouting from my shoulder blades that give me flying speed of 30 feet.", //optional; changes the racial trait description to something else
	
	features : "", //optional; the race has features defined, but this way the variant offers no features
	
	abilitySave : 0, //optional; the race has an Ability Save defined, but this way the variant offers no Ability Save
}

RaceList["something catlike"].variants = ["something great catlike"]; //Don't forget to copy this part, as it is essential to do, because it defines variant "Something Great Catlike" to the class "Something Catlike". This has to be identical to how it is written in the first line. Note the use of only lower case!

// if the race already has defined variants (as of v12.5 only the dragonborn, half-elf, human, tiefling, shifter, and minotaur do) you should use the syntax below:
RaceList["something catlike"].variants.push("something great catlike");
