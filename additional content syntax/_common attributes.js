/*	-WHAT IS THIS?-
	The script featured here is an explanation of how to make your own custom addition to MPMB's D&D 5e Character Tools.
	To add your own content to the Character Sheet, use the syntax below and save it in a file.
	You can then import this file directly to the sheet using the "Import" button and "Import/Export" bookmark.
	There you can either import the file as a whole or just copy the text into a dialog.

	-KEEP IN MIND-
	Note that you can add as many custom codes as you want, either by importing consecutive files or pasting the scripts into the dialog.
	It is recommended to enter the code in a freshly downloaded sheet or to first reset sheet.
	Thus you don't run the risk of things that have already been filled out causing conflicts.

	-HOW TO READ-
	Every line comes with a comment immediately after it to show whether it is // Optional // or // Required //,
	followed by a more explanatory comment

	-THIS IS JAVASCRIPT-
	The imports scripts work by creating a new entry inside an existing object or by calling functions.
	You can create new or overwrite existing global variables by omitting 'var'.
	You will need to understand the basics of JavaScript variables: strings, arrays, and JSON objects.
	Note that every opening symbol must have its closing counterpart: (), {}, [], "", ''.
	If these are not present, the code will give an error when imported.
	Use proper editing software for code (like Notepad++). Text processors like Microsoft Word will screw up your code.
	To help finding syntax errors, use (online) code checking software like https://jshint.com

	-COMMENTS IN THE EXAMPLE-
	Anything on a line after two forward slashes is a comment and will be ignored when running the code.
	Multiline comments are possible. Open them using the forward slash followed by an asterisk and close them with the opposite.
	The below contains a lot of these comments. The comments are not necessary for the script to work, so feel free to remove them.

	USE:	add entry to the "Actions", "Bonus Actions", or "Reactions" section on the 1st page
	CHANGE:	v13.2.3 (clarification of what will be amended and not)

	The entries in this array must always be arrays with 2 strings each:
	1. The first string in each sub-array is the type of action, written in lowercase.
		The options are "action", "bonus action", or "reaction".
	2. The second string can be one of two things:
		2.1	When the first character of the string is one of these: ` /,;:'+-` (most commonly
		a space, hyphen, or apostrophe), it is amended as a suffix to the name of the feature.
			This amended total is then added as an action.
			If you are also using the 'limfeaname' attribute, that string will be used instead of the feature's name.
			So this entry will be added to 'limfeaname' string.

			For example,
				name : "Thing", action : [["action", " (start)"]]
			will result in "Thing (start)" in the actions section.

		2.2 When the first character of the string is NOT one of the above (e.g. a letter or
		a number), it is not amended to the name of the feature.
			The string is taken as-is and added as an action.

			For example,
				name : "Thing", action : [["action", "Shove"]]
			will result in "Shove" in the actions section.

	NOTE FOR CLASS AND RACIAL FEATURES
	This attribute will do nothing when included in a class or racial feature.
	The reason for this is that the class/race sets its spellcasting ability in the parent object (for race that uses this same attribute).

	If for some reason the parent class/race object didn't set the spellcasting ability or you need to change it to a fixed attack bonus,
	you can still set it by including this attribute in one of the spellcastingBonus objects.
	This attribute will overwrite the spellcasting ability score used for calculating DC/attack (if any).
	For example, if you include this in a class feature for a wizard subclass and set it to `7`,
	the wizard will be casting spells using a spell attack of +7 regardless of its intelligence modifier.

	This setting can be overwritten for a parent by a later feature. Only the most recent is used.

	ADDED:	v13.0.8

	Normally, spells cast by magic items don't require any components other than the magic item itself.

	By setting this attribute to true, you force the sheet to remove all spell components of any spell on
	the spell sheet for the parent and replace them with just "Mƒ".
	Also, all price for the component will be removed from the short description.
	Lastly, the tooltip will no longer have the material component listed, but will rather point out that

	For a magic item, this attribute is assumed to be true by default. You only need to include it,
	if you want to set it to 'false', forcing the normal use of components.

	Be aware that setting this to true will affect all spells of the parent. It is impossible to affect
	just a single spells. To accomplish that, use `calcChanges.spellAdd` or `spellChanges`.

spellcastingExtra : ["cure wounds", "guiding bolt", "flaming sphere", "lesser restoration", "daylight", "revivify", "guardian of faith", "wall of fire", "flame strike", "greater restoration"],
/*	spellcastingExtra // OPTIONAL //
	TYPE:	array (variable length)
	USE:	adds the spells in the array to the list of spells to choose from

	The spells added here will appear in the spell selection dialog in the column "Subclass Spells".
	Although only the first 10 will be visible in the dialog, all will be used by the automation.

	Each entry must be a spell object name as used in the SpellsList object.

	For the explanation below, a reference to "spells" means spells that are 1st-level
	and higher (i.e. not cantrips).

	How the cantrips/spells are added to the spell list depends on the type of spellcasting class:
	a) spell list (cleric, druid, paladin)
		The spells are added to the generated spell sheet and marked as "always prepared".
		The cantrips are added to the cantrips known on the generated spell sheet,
		but not counted towards the number of cantrips that can be known.

		If you set the attribute `spellcastingExtraApplyNonconform` (see below) to true,
		the spells are added to the generated spell sheets, but not marked as "always prepared",
		and the cantrips are added to the lists of cantrips that the known cantrips can be selected from.

	b) spells known (bard, ranger, sorcerer, warlock)
		The cantrips/spells are added to the lists of cantrips/spells that the known cantrips/spells can be selected from.

		If you set the attribute `spellcastingExtraApplyNonconform` (see below) to true,
		the cantrips/spells are instead added to those known on the generated spell sheet
		without counting to the maximum cantrips/spells known.

	c) spellbook (wizard)
		The cantrips are added to the list of cantrips that the known cantrips can be selected from.
		The spells are added to the list of spells that the spellbook can be filled with.

		If you set the attribute `spellcastingExtraApplyNonconform` (see below) to true,
		the cantrips/spells are instead added to those known/in the spellbook on the generated spell sheet,
		without counting to the maximum cantrips known or being shown in the spell selection dialog as being part of the spellbook.

	These cantrips/spells otherwise follow the normal rules for availability (unlike `spellcastingBonus`):
	They will only appear on the generated spell sheet if the character would otherwise have
	access to spells of that level or the spell dialog is set to include all spell levels.

	This attribute will do nothing if the parent object does not grant spellcasting like a spellcasting class.

	IMPORTANT!
	Any instance of this attribute will overwrite previous instances in the same parent.
	E.g. if you use this in a subclass and in a subclass' feature, the latter will
	overwrite the former, and only the latter will be used.
	Thus, if you want to incrementally add spells,
	be sure to include previously gained spells in the array of the later feature as well.

/*	spellcastingExtraApplyNonconform // OPTIONAL //
	TYPE:	boolean
	USE:	whether to use the default (false) or variant (true) way of adding the spells defined by `spellcastingExtra` (see above)

	What this attribute does is described in the description for the `spellcastingExtra` attribute (see above).

	This attribute will do nothing if the parent object does not grant spellcasting like a spellcasting class.
	This attribute will do nothing if the parent object or a dependent object
	(e.g. a lower-level class feature) does not have the `spellcastingExtra` attribute.

	Any instance of this attribute will overwrite previous instances in the same parent.
	E.g. if you use this in a subclass and in a subclass' feature, the latter will
	overwrite the former, and only the latter will be used.

	This also means that you don't need to have `spellcastingExtra` and `spellcastingExtraApplyNonconform`
	defined in the same class feature.
	And it means that you can change the behaviour of `spellcastingExtra` at a higher level.

	Any attributes you add there will override the ones found in the SpellsList object.

	Each sub-object must have a 'changes' attribute, a string, explaining what was changed.
	This 'changes' attribute is amended to the full spell description in the tooltip.
	Use it to make clear how the spell now differs from the original version.

	// NOT ALL SpellsList ATTRIBUTES SUPPORTED //
	As these attributes are only looked into when the fields on the sheet are filled with the
	spell's attributes, there is no point in using this to change the 'classes', 'level', or
	'source' attribute of a SpellsList entry.

	// MAGIC ITEMS & SPELL COMPONENTS //
	Normally, spells cast through magic items don't require any components, so these components are
	removed by default. See the `magicItemComponents` attribute above.

	For example, you can use this attribute in a cleric class feature to change the casting time and range
	of the Spare the Dying cantrip. This is what the above example does.
	This change will then only be visible on the part of the spell sheet generated for the cleric class,
	and not for another spellcasting source, even if that also has the Spare the Dying cantrip.

	If you want to affect all spells, not just of the parent class/race/magic item/feat,
	then use the calcChanges.spellAdd attribute, see below.

	Note that these changes will never be applied when manually adding a spell to a spell sheet.
	They will only be applied when generating a spell sheet for the character.

	This attribute will do nothing if the parent object does not grant spellcasting in one way or another.

	To do this, the object must contain the `addTo` attribute and either or both the

	These attributes are discussed individually below.

	Note that you should not use this if you want to add bonus spells to spellcasting from a parent object.

			To add spells to those kind of entries, use the `spellcastingBonus` attribute.
		  * Spellcasting classes that always know all their spells (e.g. cleric, druid, paladin),
			can't have spells added this way to their known spells (cantrips will still work).

		  * The sheet only has space for 20 cantrips and 20 spells known. If the spellcaster 
			already has known spells and this list would increase the number above 20,

			Every class can still only have a maximum of 20 known cantrips, though.
		  * These added spells must still adhere to the normal restrictions of the spell list
			available for the class.

		The sheet will search for the first empty companion page (or add an empty page)
		and add this entry in the "Race" drop-down box on that page.
		This string is added exactly as it is written here, so it is recommended to capitalize it for consistency.

		If the race already exists on a companion page, it is not added.

		When the parent feature is removed, any companion page with this filled out as
		the race, will have the race reset. Thus, all stats of that race will be removed.

	2) Boolean or "stop", set to true if the whole page should be removed // OPTIONAL
		If set to true, when the parent feature is removed, any companion page with the
		1st entry filled out as the race, will be deleted without warning.
		Deleted pages can not be recovered, any information on them is lost.

		Setting this to false will cause the sheet to do the default action, which is to only
		reset the race of the companion pages with the 1st entry filled out as the race.

		Alternatively, you can set this to the string "stop", which causes the creature
		not te be removed from the companion page at all when the parent feature is removed.
		This was added in v13.1.3

	3) Function called when the creature is added/removed // OPTIONAL
		This function is called after the creature race in the 1st entry is added or
		removed from a page (even if the whole page is removed, see 2) ).

		This function is passed two variables:
		3.1) AddRemove
			A boolean that tells whether the creature was added (true) or removed (false).
		3.2) prefix
			A string with the page identifier for the companion page.
			You can use this to call on fields or invoke functions for that companion page.

		If the 1st entry race is already present on a companion page, no changes will be
		made to that page and the first such page will be used for this callback function.

		If you are adding a creature that is itself added using the `creatureOptions`
		attribute, consider not using this callback function, but adding an `eval` and
		`removeeval` to its CreatureList object instead.

	4) String of the special companion type that should be applied // OPTIONAL
		This string has to be a key in the CompanionList object.
		This companion type will be applied before the callback function above
		(3rd array entry) is called.

		Import scripts can add things to the CompanionList object, but generally these
		options should be available (if the applicable scripts are imported if they're not SRD):

		SRD   OBJECT KEY             EXPLANATION

		USE:	change how Hit Points are calculated and what the Hit Points tooltip says

		Both examples do the exact same thing, just one is a string and the other is a function.
		Writing a function is better as it is easier to avoid syntax errors.
		The string option is there for backwards-compatibility and this explanation assumes you are writing a function.

		The function will not be evaluated but is fed three variables:
		1) totalHD
			A number that represents the amount of hit dice the character has (normally equal to the character level).
			Use this to add HP equal to the current total level.
		2) HDobj
			A JSON object that has all the attributes used to generate the HP tooltip text
			and the HP average, fixed value, and maximum.

			A list of the different attributes of this variable:
			var HDobj = {
				conMod,	// number, Constitution modifier
				conCorrection, // boolean, true if the die average + Con mod is less than 1
				count, // number, the amount of hit dice (the same as totalHD)
				dieStr, // array with strings, joined together with " + " to form
				           the description of the HP gained from the hit dice, e.g.
				           ["10 (1st level)", "2d10 (11)"]
				average, // number, the total HP value when using the average of each die (e.g. 4.5 for 1d8)
				fixed, // number, the total HP value when using the fixed value for each die (e.g. 5 for 1d8)
				max, // number, the total HP value when using the maximum value for each die (e.g. 8 for 1d8)
				alt, // array with numbers, empty by default but you can push a number to the end of this array,
				        which represent an alternative HP total.
				        Doing so will cause this number to become an option in the Set Max HP button.
						If you do so, preferably also push a description to the end of the `altStr` array, see below.
				altStr // array with string, empty by default but you can push a string to the end of this array,
				          which is used as descriptive text for the alternative HP total.
						  Only do so when also adding something to the end of the `alt` array, see above.
						  This string shouldn't contain the total HP added to the `alt` array,
						  nor the name of the feature, as both will be added automatically.
			}
		3) prefix
			A string with the page identifier for the companion page.
			When this function is invoked for the main character, this will always be an empty string.
			When this function is invoked for a companion page, this is the identifier for which companion page this is for.

		The function can edit the HDobj directly to affect the hit point calculation
		and/or return an array with 1, 2, or 3 entries.
		The returned array entries will then be used as follows:
		1) The number of hit points to add [number] // REQUIRED
			If this is undefined or false, the whole addition will be ignored.
		2) The descriptive text of where the hit points come from [string] // OPTIONAL
			If you leave this out, the sheet will automatically generate a description for it.
		3) Whether (true) or not (false) [boolean] // OPTIONAL
			It this is set to true, second entry string is added as-is to the HP tooltip.
			If this is set to false (or not set at all), the tooltip will be automatically generated from the first entry number and the second entry string.

		Normally, you would not have to edit the HDobj or add a second or third entry.
		E.g. just "return [totalHD];" is enough to add 1 HP per level.

		If you want to submit a completely different calculation for the hit points,
		then push the total calculated HP to the HDobj.alt array and push the description
		to the HDobj.altStr array.
		Generally speaking, this functionality is reserved for creatures (CreatureList).
		An example:
	hp : function (totalHD, HDobj) {
		HDobj.alt.push(totalHD * 10);
		HDobj.altStr.push("I gain 10 hit points per level, regardless of hit dice or Constitution modifier.");

		// 1st array entry // REQUIRED //
		Both examples do the exact same thing, just one is a string and the other is a function.
		Writing a function is better as it is easier to avoid syntax errors and will run faster.
		The string option is there for backwards-compatibility and this explanation assumes you are writing a function.

		The function will not be evaluated but is fed three variables:
		1)	fields, an object with all the different fields for an attack entry
			Changing this object will do nothing, but you can use its input to test things
			For example, you can test if the character is proficient with the attack with 'fields.Proficiency'

			A list of the different attributes of this variable,
			see atkAdd above for a more in-depth explanation of each attribute:
			var fields = { Proficiency, Mod, Range, Damage_Type, Description, Description_Tooltip, To_Hit_Bonus, Damage_Bonus, Damage_Die, Weight };

		2)	v, an object with some information about the attack
			Changing this object will do nothing, but you can use its input to test things

			An explanation of the different attributes of this variable:
			var v = {
				WeaponText, // string, both the name and description
				WeaponTextName, // string, just the name
				isDC, // boolean, whether or not this attack has a To Hit (false) or a DC (true)
				isSpell, // boolean, whether (true) or not (false) this attack is a recognized cantrip or spell or has the word 'cantrip' or 'spell' in its name or description
				isWeapon, // boolean, whether (true) or not (false) this attack is considered a weapon attack. Be aware that something can be both a spell/cantrip and a weapon attack
				isMeleeWeapon, // boolean, whether (true) or not (false) this attack has a range of 'melee' and is considered a melee weapon attack
				isRangedWeapon, // boolean, whether (true) or not (false) this attack has a range that doesn't include 'melee' and is considered a ranged weapon attack
				isNaturalWeapon, // boolean, whether (true) or not (false) this attack has the type 'natural'
				isThrownWeapon, // boolean, whether (true) or not (false) this attack has the 'thrown' property [added v13.1.1]
				isOffHand, // boolean, whether (true) or not (false) this attack is both a melee weapon and an off-hand attack

				WeaponName, // string, the name of the entry in the WeaponsList object
				baseWeaponName, // string, the name of the entry in the WeaponsList object that the weapon is based on (or its own name if it is not based on anything)
				thisWeapon // array, the entry in the CurrentWeapons.known array
			}

		3)	output, an object with the information used to calculate the attack's To Hit & Damage
			You can change this object to affect the calculation
			For example, you can add a number to output.extraDmg to add more damage

			var output = {
				prof, // number, the proficiency bonus to use or 0 if not proficient
				die, // string, the damage die to use, identical to the fields.Damage_Die
				modToDmg, // boolean, whether to add the ability score modifier to damage (true) or not (false)
				mod, // number, the ability score modifier to use (so the value of the associated ability score set in fields.Mod)
				magic, // number, the magical bonus to add to both To Hit and Damage (0 if nothing to add)
				bHit, // string, the value of the modifier field for To Hit, identical to fields.To_Hit_Bonus
				bDmg, // string, the value of the modifier field for Damage, identical to fields.Damage_Bonus
				extraDmg, // number, amount of bonus damage to add
				extraHit // number, amount to add to attack roll ("roll To Hit")
			};

			Note that this variable, output, can be changed by consecutive calcChanges.atkCalc functions
			You can even save new attributes to it that you can use by calcChanges.atkCalc functions gained from other features

		This attribute is used both in the attacks section and on spell sheet pages,

		The 'Ability Save DC' will automatically mirror what's on the spell sheet page if there
		are not multiple sources using the same ability to determine (spell) save DCs.

		For the attacks section, this is run for cantrips/spells that are recognized, and 
		manually added attacks that have "cantrip" or "spell" in their name or description.

		// 1st array entry // REQUIRED //
		The function should return the number it wishes to add/remove as a number.
		The function will not be evaluated but is fed three variables:
		1)	type, a string with the type of the thing being processed.
			This can be one of three things:
				"dc"
				"attack"
				"prepare"

			Check against this to see if you are adding a number to the correct thing.
			For example, if you want to add 2 to the DC, but not to the spell attack
			or number of prepared spells, do the following:
				if (type == "dc") return 2;

		2)	spellcasters, an array of CurrentSpells object entry names.
			These entry names are identical to the source of the spellcasting.
			For example, it will be ["wizard"] if the thing to calculate is the wizard's spell DC/attack bonus/spells to prepare;

			Check against this if you only want to add a number to the spell save DC if a certain spellcasting class is present.
			For example, if you only want the spell DC of the cleric to be 3 higher:
				if (type == "dc" && spellcasters.indexOf("cleric") != -1) return 3;

		3)	ability, a number of the ability score being used.
			This can be one of seven numbers:
				0 = none, 1 = Str, 2 = Dex, 3 = Con, 4 = Int, 5 = Wis, 6 = Cha

			Check against this if you only want to change something if it is with a certain ability score.
			For example, if you want to add 1 to the spell attacks done with Charisma:
				if (type == "attack" && ability == 6) return 1;

		4)	spell, a string, the object name of the spell in the `SpellsList` object
			This is only used for DC/attack calculated in the attacks section,
			on the 1st page.

			The object will look as the 'common spell list object' explained in the file "_common spell list object.js".

			It will always contain the attribute 'extraspells', possibly as an empty array.
			The presence of all other attributes depends on what spell list is being generated.

			What you can do, for example, is limit the schools a class has access to by

			Or you can add spells to the list by adding them to the spList.extraspells array.
			Or you can remove spells from the list by changing or adding the spList.notspells attribute.

		2)	spName, a string that is the entry in the CurrentSpells object

			For example, this will be "wizard" for the wizard class spell list,
			"fighter" for the eldritch knight spell list,
			or "drow" for the racial spells gained from being a dark elf.

		3)	spType, a string that shows what type of spell list this is
			This can be one of multiple things:
			"book"	spellcasting class uses a spellbook (e.g. the wizard)
			"list"	spellcasting class prepares spells from a list (e.g. the cleric)
			"known"	spellcasting class has to select the spells it knows from a list (e.g. the bard)

			"race"	spellcasting source is a race and only gains spells from the spellcastingBonus feature
			"item"	spellcasting source is a magic item and only gains spells from the spellcastingBonus feature

		CHANGE:	v13.0.8 (priority, 3rd array entry)

		// 1st array entry //
		This function is called whenever a spell is added to the spell sheet,
		both when added manually and during spell sheet generation.
		You can use it to dynamically change something about a spell like its description, range, or school.
		This function is passed four variables:
		1)	spellKey, a string of the name of the entry in the SpellsList variable.
			Thus, you can find the original SpellsList entry with SpellsList[spellKey].

		2)	spellObj, the object of the entry which you can edit.
			This has the same attributes as a SpellsList entry, see the syntax file "spells (SpellsList).js".
			The only exception is that when using the metric system, both the 'description' and 'range' attribute
			will already have been converted into their metric versions.
			Also, it will have the `firstCol` attribute set to whatever the automation wants it to be and
			you can change it here to something else (e.g. change a 'checkbox' to a 'markedbox').

		3)	spName, a string that is the entry in the CurrentSpells object
			This string will be identical to whatever added the spellcasting feature.
			For example, this will be "wizard" for the wizard class spell list,
			"fighter" for the eldritch knight spell list,
			or "drow" for the racial spells gained from being a dark elf.
			This will be an empty string when the spell is added manually.

		4)	isDuplicate, a boolean that is true if the spell is a duplicate
			This is intended for spells that are added using the 'spellcastingBonus' attribute, but are also present on the spell list otherwise.
			For duplicate spells like this, the first time the spell is added,
			it is treated as the one gained from 'spellcastingBonus', and this boolean is set to false.
			Then, the second time this spell is added, it is treated as the one gained from the regular spell list and this attribute is true.


		By changing the attributes of the spellObj, you change what is put in the fields.
		Changing that object has no affect on the original SpellsList entry.

		Since v13.0.7 you can call on the `genericSpellDmgEdit()` function to automatically increase
		the damage or healing of a spell.
		This function dynamically adds an ability modifier, value, or die to the damage
		or healing displayed in the short description on the spell sheet.

		genericSpellDmgEdit(spellKey, spellObj, dmgType, ability, notMultiple, onlyRolls, maximizeRolls)
		  This function requires 7 parameters (the first 4 are required), which are as follows:
		1)	spellKey, a string, same as the one above

		2)	spellObj, the object of the spell entry, same as the one above

		3)	dmgType, a string that will be used to create the regular expression, or "heal"
			If you set this to "heal", the function will only look at healing spells
			This string can be a damage type, or multiple, separated with a pipe character (which
			functions as 'or' in regular expression).
			For example, use "fire|radiant" to match both fire and radiant spells.
			The match has to be for the whole word, but some damage types can be abbreviated, see below.
			Thus, if you want to match a spell that deals lightning damage, enter "lightning|lightn.".
			IMPORTANT: do not use capturing groups!

		4)	ability, a string or number, which will be added to the damage/healing
			This can be the three-letter abbreviation for an ability score (Str, Dex, Con, Int, Wis, or Cha),
			a die (e.g. "1d6"), a number, or anything you'd want to add to the damage (e.g "2/SL").
			Make sure the abbreviation has its first letter capitalized.

		5)	notMultiple, boolean whether to add the bonus to only one instance (true) or multiple (false)
			This parameter is optional, if you don't set it, it will assume `false`.

		6)	onlyRolls, boolean whether to add the bonus to only rolls (true) or also fixed values (false)
			This parameter is optional, if you don't set it, it will assume `false`.

		7)	maximizeRolls, boolean whether to replace all dice with their maximum value (true) or not (false)
			This parameter is optional, if you don't set it, it will assume `false`.

		Some longer damage type names can be shortened in the spell short descriptions:
			DAMAGE TYPE    SHORTENED
			Bludgeoning    Bludg.
			Lightning      Lightn.
			Necrotic       Necro.
			Piercing       Pierc.
			Slashing       Slash.

		This function is processed after the 'spellChanges' attribute.
		If you need to change only spells for one spellcasting source, use the 'spellChanges' attribute above.

		If the sheet is set to use the metric system, the conversion to metric will be done before
		this function is processed.
		Thus, if your manipulation includes imperial units, make sure to convert them to metric.

		This function will only be processed if the checkbox "Allow features to dynamically change spells"
		in the final spell selection dialog is checked.

		// 2nd array entry // OPTIONAL //
		This has to be a string and will be shown in the "Changes" dialog when this feature is added/removed.
		This explanation is also available under the Companion Options button on any companion page.

addMod : [
	{ type : "skill", field : "Init", mod : "Int", text : "I can add my Intelligence modifier to initiative rolls." },
	{ type : "save", field : "all", mod : "max(Cha|1)", text : "While I'm conscious I can add my Charisma modifier (min 1) to all my saving throws." },
],
/*	addMod // OPTIONAL //
	TYPE:	array of objects (variable length)
	USE:	add value to a modifier field

	You can have any number of objects in this array, each object must have the same four attributes, all of which are strings:
	1. type
		Can be "skill", "save", or "dc", but can also be left empty "".
	2. field
		What to add here depends on the type-

		a)	for "skill" it can be the name of a skill (e.g. "Acrobatics"),
			or "Init" for initiative,
			or "Too" for the optional tool/skill for which you can change the name,
			or "all" for the all skills modifier,
			or "pass" for the passive perception modifier.

		b)	for "save" it can be the three-letter abbreviation of an ability score,
			or "all" for the all saves modifier.

		c)	for "dc" it can be the three-letter abbreviation of an ability score.
			In this context, "dc" refers to the Ability Save DC on the front page.
			This option is not available for a CreatureList object, as the companion page
			doesn't have a separate space for Ability Save DC.
			Do NOT use this to increase Spell Save DCs, use calcChanges.spellCalc instead.

		d)	for "" it has to be the exact name of the field as used in the PDF.
			common ones include:
			"Proficiency Bonus Modifier"	// modifier field for proficiency bonus
			"Age"							// age description field
			"SpellSlots.CheckboxesSet.lvlX"	// amount of spellslot checkboxes to show, 
									where X is replaced with the level (1-9).
									N.B. These fields can only be a positive number,
									you can't pre-emptively add "-1",
									nor use any dynamic modifier like "Int" or "Prof".

	3. mod
		This can be any combination of numbers, mathematical operators,
		and three-letter ability score abbreviations for ability score modifiers,
		or 'Prof' for the proficiency bonus.

		USABLE	RESULT
		Str 	Strength modifier
		Dex 	Dexterity modifier
		Con 	Constitution modifier
		Int 	Intelligence modifier
		Wis 	Wisdom modifier
		Cha 	Charisma modifier
		HoS 	7th ability modifier, if used (Honour or Sanity)
		Prof	Proficiency bonus

		When used in a CreatureList object, you can add the lowercase letter "o"
		in front of any of these to reference the modifier of the main character.
		E.g. "oStr" is the Strength modifier of the main character, while just "Str" refers
		to the Strength modifier of the companion.
		Note that AddMod in a CreatureList object is not applied for wild shapes.

		Additionally, you can use min(1|2) and max(1|2), which work like Math.min(1,2)
		and Math.max(1,2).
		Note that the pipe character is used instead of a comma.
		
		You can use brackets for complex calculations, but you can't use brackets within
		the brackets of the min() and max() operators.
		Everything seperated by a pipe symbol is calculated separately.
		For example "max(Cha+1|2)" will get the highest of "Charisma modifier + 1" and "2".

		Modifiers can only be integers (whole numbers, no decimals).
		Any resulting value that is not an integer will be rounded down (as per the rules,
		all values are rounded down in D&D 5e unless stated otherwise).

		For example, to add the proficiency bonus, Constitution modifier, and subtract 2, it would look like this:
			mod : "Prof+Con-2",
		Or, another example, to add 1, it would look like this:
			mod : 1,
		Or, another example, to add the Charisma modifier with a minimum of 1, it would look like this:
			mod : "max(Cha|1)",
		Or, another example, to add half the Charisma modifier rounded up with a minimum of 1, it would look like this:
			mod : "max(Cha+1|2)/2",
		Or, an example for the companion page, to add the Intelligence modifier of the main
		character with a maximum of 3, it would look like this:
			mod : "min(oInt|3)",

		When using this to add something to the Damage Die modifier field, it is also
		possible to use dice notation (e.g. "1d6"). [ADDED v13.0.8]
		Dice notation can't be combined with 'max' or 'min'.
		Normally this should only be used on the companion page as scaling damage die for
		the main character is better handled by adding a `calcChanges.atkAdd` attribute.

	4. text
		This is an explanation of why the modifier was added and is used in the
		modifier change dialog, which appears when clicking the modifier field.

	NOTE: for modifiers to attacks, use calcChanges.atkCalc
	NOTE: for modifiers to AC, use extraAC
	NOTE: for modifiers to spell save DCs, use calcChanges.spellCalc

	/*	stopeval // OPTIONAL //
		TYPE:	function
		USE:	return 'true' if the modifier is NOT to be added

		With this function you can dynamically determine if the modifier should be added or not,
		by testing against certain criteria.

		The function is fed one variable, an object with attributes you can use:
		var v = {
			theArmor,		// the ArmourList object, if the current armour is recognized
			usingShield,	// boolean, if the shield field has any text in it (true) or not (false)
			wearingArmor,	// boolean, if the current armour is light/medium/heavy (true) or not (false)
							// 'wearingArmor' is false for unarmoured, unarmoured defense, natural armor, and spells (e.g. Mage Armor)
			mediumArmor,	// if the 'Medium Armor' checkbox is checked (true) or not (false)
			heavyArmor,		// if the 'Heavy Armor' checkbox is checked (true) or not (false)
			shieldProf,		// if the 'Shield' proficiency checkbox is checked (true) or not (false)
			lightProf,		// if the 'Light' armour proficiency checkbox is checked (true) or not (false)
			mediumProf,		// if the 'Medium' armour proficiency checkbox is checked (true) or not (false)
			heavyProf		// if the 'Heavy' armour proficiency checkbox is checked (true) or not (false)
		}

		The above example returns true when the character is wearing armour,
		and if so the sheet will not add the modifier to the total AC.
