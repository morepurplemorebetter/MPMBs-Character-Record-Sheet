/*	-WHAT IS THIS?-
	The script featured here is an explanation of how to make your own custom addition to MPMB's D&D 5e Character Tools.
	You can add custom content to the Character Sheet's functionality by adding a script written with the syntax shown below in the "Add Custom Script" dialogue.
	
	-KEEP IN MIND-
	Note that you can add as many custom codes as you want, but you have to add the code in at once (i.e. copy all the code into a single, long file and copy that into the sheet).
	It is recommended to enter the code in a fresh sheet before adding any other information.
*/

/*	-INFORMATION-
	Subject:	Spell
	Effect:		This is the syntax for adding a new spell
	Sheet:		v12.998 (2017-09-15)
	
	Please note that there is no code here to update drop-down boxes because the rop-down boxes in the spell selection dialogues are generated automatically and will include any spells you add correctly
	
	If you are looking for a way to add a cantrip/spell to the drop-down boxes in the attack sections, then you will have to look at the WeaponsList syntax and add the cantrip/spell as a weapon (as well)
