/*	-WHAT IS THIS?-
	The script featured here is an explanation of how to make your own custom addition to MPMB's D&D 5e Character Tools.
	You can add custom content to the Character Sheet's functionality by adding a script written with the syntax shown below in the "Add Custom Script" dialogue.
	
	-KEEP IN MIND-
	Note that you can add as many custom codes as you want, but you have to add the code in at once (i.e. copy all the code into a single, long file and copy that into the sheet).
	It is recommended to enter the code in a fresh sheet before adding any other information.
