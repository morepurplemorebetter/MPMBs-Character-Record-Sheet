/*	-WHAT IS THIS?-
	The script featured here is an explanation of how to make your own custom addition to MPMB's D&D 5e Character Tools.
	You can add custom content to the Character Sheet's functionality by adding a script written with the syntax shown below in the "Add Custom Script" dialogue.
	
	-KEEP IN MIND-
	Note that you can add as many custom codes as you want, but you have to add the code in at once (i.e. copy all the code into a single, long file and copy that into the sheet).
	It is recommended to enter the code in a fresh sheet before adding any other information.
*/

/*	-INFORMATION-
	Subject:	Class
	Effect:		This is the syntax for adding a new class to the sheet
				Note that you will need the syntax for adding a subclass as well if you want the class to have any choices for subclasses
	Sheet:		v12.998 (2017-09-22)

			savetxt : { // Optional; this attribute defines entries to add to the field for "Saving Throw Advantages / Disadvantages"
			
				text : ["Dex save vs. area effects: fail \u2015 half dmg, success \u2015 no dmg", "Magic can't put me to sleep"], // Optional; this is an array of strings, and each of those strings is added to the field exactly as presented here
				
				immune : ["poison", "disease"], // Optional; this is an array of strings that the character is immune to. This is put in the field after the text "Immune to ", so in this example it would result in "Immune to poison and disease"
				
				adv_vs : ["traps", "charmed"] // Optional; this is an array of things that the character has advantage on saves against. This is put in the field after the text "Adv. on saves vs. ", so in this example it would result in "Adv. on saves vs. traps and charmed"

			dmgres : ["Poison"], //optional; an array of damage types that the class gets resistance against. // If the resistance has a condition attached to it, like only being against nonmagical attacks, substitute the entry in the array with an array of 2: [the damage type, the damage type with the condition]. // For example: [["Bludgeoning", "Bludg. (nonmagical)"], ["Piercing", "Pierc. (nonmagical)"], ["Slashing", "Slash. (nonmagical)"]]
			
			saves : ["Con"] //optional; an array of the ability scores with which the class feature grants proficiency in saving throws
	
			toolProfs : [["Musical instrument", 3], ["Thieves' tools", "Dex"]], // optional; this is an array with the tool proficiencies gained. Each entry can be its own array of 2 entries. The first entry is the name of the tool and the second entry is either 1) a number if the tool is yet to be chosen, or 2) the 3-letter ability score abbreviation if the tool is to be listed in the skill section and have a bonus calculated
			
			languageProfs : [1, "Elvish"], // optional; this is an array of the language proficiencies gained. An entry can either be 1) a string that represents the language learned or 2) a number which is the number of language gained that can be chosen by the player
			
			speed : { //required; This sets a value for one or more speed modes, and/or a value to be added to a specific speed mode or to all speed modes // the attributes of this object can be "walk", "borrow", "climb", "fly", "swim", and "allModes"
					
				// all of the following attributes are optional and you can add more ("borrow" isn't part of this example!)
				
				walk : { spd : 30, enc : 20 }, // the objects "walk", "borrow", "climb", "fly", "swim" are all the same, they are an object with two attributes, 'spd' for the speed in feet, and 'enc' for the encumbered speed in feet.
				
				climb : { spd : "+50", enc : 0 }, // instead of numbers, you can also have modifiers. Modifiers are a string, starting with a mathematical operator, followed by a number (e.g. "-10", "+20"). // a value that is zero is ignored
				
				fly : { spd : "walk", enc : 0 }, // instead of a number/modifier, you can also set the attribute to "walk". This makes the speed mode assume the walking speed // Using an underscore as the first character means the value is only added if the value would be non-zero
				
				swim : { spd : "fixed60", enc : "fixed60" }, // if you include the word "fixed" together with a number, the movement mode will be that number, without any modifiers from other sources (like the Monk's speed bonus). However, if another entry that isn't 'fixed' does end up with a higher total while including any modifiers, that speed is used instead
				
				allModes : "+10" // the 'allModes' attribute can only consist of a modifier. This modifier is applied to all speed modes, both normal and encumbered. It is only applied if the speed mode exists, it won't give the character a borrow speed if it would otherwise have none, for example
