/*	-WHAT IS THIS?-
	The script featured here is an explanation of how to make your own custom addition to MPMB's D&D 5e Character Tools.
	You can add custom content to the Character Sheet's functionality by adding a script written with the syntax shown below in the "Add Custom Script" dialogue.
	
	-KEEP IN MIND-
	Note that you can add as many custom codes as you want, but you have to add the code in at once (i.e. copy all the code into a single, long file and copy that into the sheet).
	It is recommended to enter the code in a fresh sheet before adding any other information.

			// Note that you need to use two back slashes for things in the eval code here, because it is first added to a string, and then run as code. See the hp for an example, with the \\n
			
			// For the eval strings for the attack calculations ('atkCalc' or 'atkAdd') there are some variables that you can use to test against:

This object has the following attributes: output.prof (wether or not to add the proficiency bonus to the To Hit), output.die (Damage Die to use), output.mod (ability modifier), output.modToDmg (wether or not to add the ability modifier to Damage), output.magic (any magic bonus that's to be added to both To Hit and Damage), output.bHit (the To Hit bonus from the Blue Text/Modifier field), output.bDmg (the Damage bonus from the Blue Text/Modifier field), output.extraHit (a number added to the To Hit that is reserved for this eval), output.extraDmg (a number added to the damage that is reserved for this eval)

The second value is the range in feet. If no range is needed, put a 0 there. You can also add a modifier like "+30" or "*2" to have the appropriate calculation done with the range of sense
	
	addMod : { type : "skill", field : "Init", mod : "Int", text : "I can add my Intelligence modifier to initiative rolls." } //optional; This is an object, or an array of similar objects, for adding a modifier to a modifier field. Using this will make it so that the modifier is added to any value that is already there. // The 'mod' attribute can be any combination of numbers, mathematical operators, and three-letter ability score abbreviations // The 'type' attribute can be "skill" or "save", but can also be left empty "" // The 'field' attribute depends on the type, for "skill" it can be the name of a skill, or "Init" for initiative, or "All" for the all skills modifier; for "save" it can be the three-letter abbreviation of an ability score, or "All" for the all saves modifier. // If the 'type' attribute is left empty, the 'field' attribute has to be the exact name of the field the modifier has to be added to // The 'text' attribute is an explanation of why the modifier was added //NOTE: for modifiers to attacks, use calcChanges

		climb : { spd : "+50", enc : 0 }, // instead of numbers, you can also have modifiers. Modifiers are a string, starting with a mathematical operator, followed by a number (e.g. "-10", "+20"). // a value that is zero is ignored
		
		fly : { spd : "walk", enc : 0 }, // instead of a number/modifier, you can also set the attribute to "walk". This makes the speed mode assume the walking speed // Using an underscore as the first character means the value is only added if the value would be non-zero
		
		swim : { spd : "fixed60", enc : "fixed60" }, // if you include the word "fixed" together with a number, the movement mode will be that number, without any modifiers from other sources (like the Monk's speed bonus). However, if another entry that isn't 'fixed' does end up with a higher total while including any modifiers, that speed is used instead
		
		allModes : "+10" // the 'allModes' attribute can only consist of a modifier. This modifier is applied to all speed modes, both normal and encumbered. It is only applied if the speed mode exists, it won't give the character a borrow speed if it would otherwise have none, for example
