/*	-WHAT IS THIS?-
	The script featured here is an explanation of how to make your own custom addition to MPMB's D&D 5e Character Tools.
	To add your own content to the Character Sheet, use the syntax below and save it in a file.
	You can then import this file directly to the sheet using the "Import" button and "Import/Export" bookmark.
	There you can either import the file as a whole or just copy the text into a dialogue.

	-KEEP IN MIND-
	Note that you can add as many custom codes as you want, either by importing consecutive files or pasting the scripts into the dialogue.
	It is recommended to enter the code in a freshly downloaded sheet or to first reset sheet.
	Thus you don't run the risk of things that have already been filled out causing conflicts.

	-HOW TO READ-
	Every line comes with a comment immediately after it to show whether it is // Optional // or // Required //,
	followed by a more explanatory comment

	-THIS IS JAVASCRIPT-
	The imports scripts work by creating a new entry inside an existing object or by calling functions.
	You can create new or overwrite existing global variables by omitting 'var'.
	You will need to understand the basics of JavaScript variables: strings, arrays, and JSON objects.
	Note that every opening symbol must have its closing counterpart: (), {}, [], "", ''.
	If these are not present, the code will give an error when imported.
	Use proper editing software for code (like Notepad++). Text processors like Microsoft Word will screw up your code.
	To help finding syntax errors, use (online) code checking software like https://jshint.com

	-COMMENTS IN THE EXAMPLE-
	Anything on a line after two forward slashes is a comment and will be ignored when running the code.
	Multiline comments are possible. Open them using the forward slash followed by an asterisk and close them with the opposite.
	The below contains a lot of these comments. The comments are not necessary for the script to work, so feel free to remove them.
*/

/*	-INFORMATION-

	Subject:	Spell

	Effect:		This is the syntax for adding a new spell to the sheet.

	Remarks:	This does not add anything to the attack section.
				If you want attack cantrips or spells to be added to the attack section,
				use the syntax for adding a weapon (as well), see "weapon (WeaponsList).js".

	Sheet:		v14.0.0 and newer

	Note that this is a variable called 'iFileName'.
	Variables invoked inside an import script will not be available after importing.
	However, if you invoke the variable without the 'var', it will be available after importing.

	This doesn't have to be the same as the actual name of the file.
	This doesn't need to have the .js file extension.
	Only the first occurrence of this variable will be used.

	The variable you input can be a the full semantic version of the sheet as a string (e.g. "13.0.6" or "13.1.0-beta1+201209").
	Alternatively, you can input a number, which the sheet will translate to a semantic version.
	For example:
		FUNCTION CALL						REQUIRED MINIMUM VERSION
		`RequiredSheetVersion(13);`			13.0.0
		`RequiredSheetVersion(13.1);`		13.1.0

	You can find the full semantic version of the sheet at the bottom of every page,

	Note that the sheet normally uses the first person for this.
	Make sure that this description is not too long and fits on the small description field on the spell sheet page.
	The Colourful sheets have less space for spell descriptions than the Printer Friendly versions,
	so use the Colourful sheets to test if the description fits.

	If the sheet is set to use the metric system, this attribute will be converted automatically.

	// IMPORTANT //
	If the spell does damage, make sure the damage is written as "XdY+CdZ/SL [Type] dmg".
		- Replace [Type] with the a single word, the damage type with the first letter capitalized
		  (e.g. Fire or Lightning).
		- You can write "damage" instead of "dmg".
		- "+CdZ/SL" represents the bonus damage die per spell slot level above the spell's level. For example,
		  this is written as "8d6+1d6/SL fire dmg" for Fireball, which adds 1d6 to the damage for each spell 
		  slot used above 3rd-level (the level of the spell).
		- The damage die don't necessarily have to include a bonus per spell slot level above current level,
		  nor be a die at all, static damage also works. E.g. "2d8 Thunder dmg" and "5 Cold dmg" are valid.
	If the spell heals hit points, make sure it is written as "heal XdY+CdZ/SL HP"
		- "heal" can also be replaces with "heals" or "to life with" (e.g. Raise Dead).
		- "HP" can also be replaces with "hit point" or "hit points".
		- "+CdZ/SL" works the same as explained above in the damage example.
		- The healing and bonus per spell slot level can also be static (e.g. "heals 100 HP" is valid).

	You can shorten longer damage type names if they won't otherwise fit:
		DAMAGE TYPE    SHORTENED
		Bludgeoning    Bludg.
		Lightning      Lightn.
		Necrotic       Necro.
		Piercing       Pierc.
		Slashing       Slash.
	
	If the damage (or only some of the damage) in the description doesn't match this syntax,
	you can use the `dynamicDamageBonus` object (see below) to tell the script how to find the damage string.

	is checked when generating a spell sheet.

	If set to do so, the sheet replaces the `CD` with the cantrip die for the character's current level.
	You can also add modifiers to this, as long as they are after the CD and between the back ticks.

	This description will also be available in a pop-up by using the button in the spell's line.
	There is no limit to how big this description can be,
	but very long descriptions will not always display correctly.

	From v14.0.0 onwards, this attribute can be an array. Each entry in the array will be put
	on a new line. Each entry can be one of the following:
		1. String.
		   If the entry is a string that doesn't start with a space character and
		   it is not the first entry, it will be added on a new line,
		   proceeded by three spaces (i.e. `\n   `).
		   If the entry is a string that starts with a space character, it will be added
		   on a new line, but without any preceding spaces.
		   For example, to make a bullet point list, you would use ` \u2022 list entry`
		   (N.B. `\u2022` is unicode for a bullet point).
		2. Array of arrays, which contain only strings
		   If the entry is in itself an array, it is treated as a table.
		   Each entry in that array is a row in the table, with the first row being the headers.
		   The headers will be made bold and italic. This is done with unicode. If unicode is
		   disabled, the sheet will capitalize this instead.
		   Each subarray is rendered with a tab between each column (i.e. `Array.join("\t")`).
		   If instead of a subarray there is a string, it will be added as is.
		   The table will be preceded by two line breaks and followed by one line break.

	You can see an example of this array method above.

	From v14.0.0 onwards, if you put '>>' and '<<' around a part of the string,
	that part will be made bold and italic in the displayed description. This is done with
	unicode. If unicode is disabled, the sheet will capitalize this instead.

	If the description attribute given above is too long to fit an extra bit added by the
	`genericSpellDmgEdit` function, then you can use this attribute to present an alternative, shorter
	description that the `genericSpellDmgEdit` function can use to alter.
	How much shorter you should make this description depends on the addition the `genericSpellDmgEdit`
	function will do, depending on context, see the three scenarios below.

	There are four scenarios:
	1) Single damage instance of single damage type (e.g. instantaneous spell)
		If the spell has a duration of instant(enous), 1 r(ou)nd, or
		includes "Next (melee/ranged) weapon at(tac)k" in the description,
		or has multiple damages listed that fit the syntax (e.g. "1d4 Fire dmg + 1d4 Cold dmg"),
		it will be considered a spell with a single damage instance.

		The damage bonus will be added to the current damage string (e.g. "5d6+1d6/SL Psychic dmg" could
		become "5d6+1d8+1d6/SL Psychic dmg").
		Thus you will need to make sure "+1d8" fits in the `description` attribute and if not,
		include a `descriptionShorter` attribute where it would fit.

	2) Multiple damage instances of single damage type (e.g. spell that deals damage each round)
		If the spell has a duration other than instant(enous), 1 r(ou)nd,
		and doesn't include "Next (melee/ranged) weapon at(tac)k" in the description,
		and doesn't have multiple damages listed that fit the syntax (e.g. "1d4 Fire dmg + 1d4 Cold dmg"),
		it will be considered a spell with multiple damage instances.

		If the feature only adds damage to a single roll, the damage bonus will be added at the end of the
		description, in the format "(1× +dX)" (e.g. "(1× +d8)" or (1× +5)),
		thus you need to make sure "(1× +d8)" fits in the `description` attribute and if not,
		include a `descriptionShorter` attribute where it would fit.

	3) Single damage instance of multiple damage type
		Same as 1), but the spell can have different damage types (e.g. you get to choose the type).
		>> Make sure you also use the `dynamicDamageBonus` attribute below.

		If the feature only adds damage to some of the damage type options, the damage bonus will be added
		at the end of the description, in the format "(+dX if..)" (e.g. "(+d8 if..)" or (+5 if..)),
		thus you need to make sure "(+d8 if..)" fits in the `description` attribute and if not,
		include a `descriptionShorter` attribute where it would fit.

	4) Multiple damage instances instances of multiple damage type
		Same as 2), but the spell can have different damage types (e.g. you get to choose the type).
		>> Make sure you also use the `dynamicDamageBonus` attribute below.

		If the feature only adds damage to some of the damage type options, the damage bonus will be added
		at the end of the description, in the format "(1× +dX if..)" (e.g. "(1× +d8 if..)" or (1× +5 if..)),
		thus you need to make sure "(1× +d8 if..)" fits in the `description` attribute and if not,
		include a `descriptionShorter` attribute where it would fit.

	Which scenario a spell falls into can be changed with the `dynamicDamageBonus` attribute below.

	// DOES NOT WORK TOGETHER WITH descriptionCantripDie //
	If the spell has both this attribute and the 'descriptionCantripDie' attribute,
	the sheet will use the 'descriptionCantripDie' attribute when the appropriate checkbox
	is checked (see 'descriptionCantripDie' explanation above).
*/
	descriptionShorterMetric : "6-m rad all crea 5d6+1d6/SL Psychic dmg; save half; flames in area are purple",
/*	descriptionShorterMetric // OPTIONAL //
	TYPE:	string
	USE:	shorter version of the description of the spell to be filled in the description field when the sheet is set to use the metric system
	ADDED:	v13.0.7

	This attribute works the same as the `descriptionShorter` attribute above,
	but it is only used if the sheet is set to use the metric system.
	If this attribute is present, the sheet will not try and convert the `descriptionShorter` attribute
	to the metric system, but will use this attribute instead.

	The sheet is good at transforming units as long as each number is followed by the unit.
	For example "60 ft by 20 ft" will successfully be converted to "18 m by 6 m",
	but "60 by 20 ft" will become "60 by 6 m".
	It is only for cases like the latter that `descriptionShorterMetric` is necessary,
	all other things can be converted by the sheet on the fly.

	// DOES NOT WORK TOGETHER WITH descriptionCantripDie //
	If the spell has both this attribute and the 'descriptionCantripDie' attribute,
	the sheet will use the 'descriptionCantripDie' attribute when the appropriate checkbox
	is checked (see 'descriptionCantripDie' explanation above),
	regardless of the unit system being set to metric.

		If the description of the spell as it will be displayed on the sheet includes damage,

		conditions set by a feature.
		If this is not desired, because the damage listed is to yourself for example, set this attribute
		to true, to have the `genericSpellDmgEdit` function skip over this spell.
		Other examples include summoned creatures/objects that deal damage, or spells that alter

		See the explanation for `descriptionShorter` above for how the `genericSpellDmgEdit` function
		normally determines wether the spell has a single or multiple damage instances.
		Only use this attribute if the `genericSpellDmgEdit` function yields the wrong outcome.

		Set this attribute to `true` if this spell has a duration of instant(enous) or 1 r(ou)nd,
		but still deals damage more than once.

		Set this attribute to `false` if the spell has a duration longer than instant(enous) or 1 r(ou)nd,
		but still only deals it damage once.

		For example, a spell with a duration of "concentration, up to 1 minute" that can be ended to deal
		damage, will be recognized as a spell that has multiple damage instances because of its duration.
		For this spell, you should set this attribute to false.
	
		If a spell has a duration of "instantaneous" but has you make multiple attack rolls for different
		targets, that spell doesn't have a single damage roll.
		For this spell, you should set this attribute to true.

		Set this attribute to `true` if this spell has multiple damages that fit the syntax,
		but those are different damage types that are still dealt at the same time (a 'single' damage roll).

		For example, a spell can deal both Radiant and Fire damage in one instance and have this listed
		in its `description` attribute as "4d6 Fire dmg and 4d6 Radiant dmg".
		The `genericSpellDmgEdit` function would consider this multiple damage instances.
		For this spell, you should set this attribute to true.

		extraDmgGroupsSameType : /((?:\+?\d+d?\d*)+)( crit)/i,
	/*	allDmgTypesSingleMoment // OPTIONAL //
		TYPE:	regular expression
		USE:	regex to match other damage instances in the description of the same damage type that doesn't adhere to the normal syntax

		This attribute tells the `genericSpellDmgEdit` function that there is another damage instance
		in the description, but that instance does not adhere to the normal syntax of "[Dice} [Type] dmg".

		This regular expression is used to match the secondary (or more) damage groups and add the damage
		bonus there as well (if required).

		The regular expression needs to include a group that matches the damage dice or static number.
		The regular expression needs to include one or more non-optional matching groups before or after
		the group that matches the damage dice or static number.

		For the damage (die) group, this matching group is recommended: ((?:\+?\d+d?\d*)+)
		As that matches any number of consecutive die and numbers, joined with a "+", but captures them as
		a single group.

		For example, a spell can deal both Radiant damage both when it is cast and the round after,
		but because of space limitations, it is written in its `description` attribute as
		"Spell attack for 4d4+1d4/SL Acid dmg and 2d4+1d4/SL next turn".
		The "2d4+1d4/SL next turn" does not adhere to the normal way of writing the damage, as it doesn't
		include a damage type or the word "dmg" (or "damage").
		The `genericSpellDmgEdit` function would not see this second damage group and thus not account for it.
		For this spell, you should set this attribute to /(and |\u0026 )((?:\+?\d+d?\d*)+)/i.

	/*	multipleDmgTypes // OPTIONAL //
		TYPE:	object (with exactly two attributes)
		USE:	the damage type of the spell can be two or more different types and/or doesn't adhere to the normal syntax in the description

		This attribute tells the `genericSpellDmgEdit` function that the damage listed in the description
		can be with multiple different damage types, which is chosen by the caster at the time of casting.
		This will (most likely) cause the description to not adhere the normal syntax of "[Dice} [Type] dmg".

		This object has two attributes of its own, both of which are REQUIRED:
		1) dmgTypes, an array
			This is the array of damage types that the spell can use.
			Use one entry per damage type (e.g. don't do ["fire or radiant"], but ["fire", "radiant"]).
		2) inDescriptionAs, a string
			This tells the `genericSpellDmgEdit` function how to find this damage type,
			as it isn't doesn't adhere to the normal syntax.
			This string is add to a regular expression, after the group matching damage dice/numbers, and
			before the group " (dmg|damage)".
			Thus, if the spell's description is "1d6 Fire or Radiant dmg", this attribute would be
			"Fire or Radiant".
			However, if the spell's description is "damage of 1d6 Fire or Radiant", this object won't work.

		See also the explanation for `descriptionShorter` above for how the `genericSpellDmgEdit` function
		for the implications of having multiple damage types.

		TYPE:	regular expression
		USE:	the spell has multiple damage instances and/or types and if the bonus should only be added to a single roll the `genericSpellDmgEdit` function, skip one or more damage instances before adding the bonus

		This attribute only does something if the `genericSpellDmgEdit` function is initialised to only
		add the damage bonus to one roll and this spell's description lists multiple that adhere
		to the syntax of "[Dice} [Type] dmg".

		Normally, the `genericSpellDmgEdit` function will add the bonus to the first damage instance that
		matches its input.
		With this object, it can skip one or more damage instances before adding the bonus.

		This regular expression that matches the groups to be skipped, up to the group where the bonus
		should be added.
		Make sure that this regular expression is a single capturing group for the whole of
		the expression (e.g. not /atk.*(piercing dmg).*?/i or /(atk.*)?(piercing dmg.*?)/i).
		You can use non-capturing groups, as long as they are within the capturing group
		(e.g. /((?:atk.*)?piercing dmg.*?)/i)

		Note that if the call for the `genericSpellDmgEdit` function was for a specific damage type
		that doesn't match the preferred group, but does match this first group that should be skipped,
		the function is still going to add the damage to the first group, effectively ignoring this attribute.
